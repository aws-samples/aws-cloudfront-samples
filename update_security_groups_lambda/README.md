To be able to make sufficient use of this Lambda function, you will require a role with a number of permissions. An example policy is as follows:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:[region]:[account-id]:security-group/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                 "logs:CreateLogStream",
                 "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Be sure to replace `[region]` with the AWS Region for your security groups, and `[account-id]` with your account number.
