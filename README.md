## update_security_groups_lambda

This AWS Lambda function is written in Python and can be used to automatically
update EC2 security group ingress rules when CloudFront IP ranges change.

By subscribing this function to the SNS topic
[AmazonIpSpaceChanged](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html#subscribe-notifications)
your security groups that are properly tagged will be updated accordingly.


For more information on ip-ranges.json, read the documentation on [AWS IP Address Ranges](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).

## amazon-cloudfront-staging-to-production

You can define environment variables separately and pipeline your changes.
